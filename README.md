# Lelym AI  

Lelym AI is an AI-powered platform designed for real-time collection and analysis of large volumes of diverse data related to cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The system enhances the accuracy of price and trading volume forecasts by integrating multiple information sources (social media, news portals, on-chain data) with advanced machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis.

## 2. Key Functional Modules  

1. **Social Media Analytics**  
   - Monitoring mentions of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and related topics on Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms.  
   - Sentiment analysis to detect real-time trends and assess public perception.  
   - Filtering out "noisy" activity (bots, fake news) using ML models.  

2. **News & Media Analysis**  
   - Automated aggregation of articles and press releases from major news sources (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Bloomberg, etc.).  
   - Assessing the "hype level" around specific events (e.g., token listings on major exchanges).  
   - Utilizing NLP techniques to analyze content and sentiment in publications.  

3. **On-Chain Metrics**  
   - Collecting and analyzing network activity data (transaction count, active addresses, transaction volume).  
   - Evaluating mining/validation status (hash rate, staking activity, miner/validator distribution).  
   - Developing indicators reflecting blockchain fundamentals, such as the ratio of new addresses to total addresses.  

4. **Historical Volatility Analysis**  
   - Storing and analyzing time-series data of prices and trading volumes across multiple exchanges.  
   - Evaluating volatility patterns and linking historical spikes/crashes to external events.  
   - Implementing regression and time-series models (ARIMA, LSTM, etc.) for short- and long-term volatility prediction.  

5. **Alerts & Risk Management Indicators**  
   - Customizable alerts for sudden price spikes/drops, volume surges, or other anomalies.  
   - Combining traditional indicators (RSI, MACD) with AI-powered analytics incorporating social media activity.  
   - Risk management module: calculating potential losses, liquidation levels, and hedging recommendations.  

6. **Flexible Database Architecture**  
   - Centralized storage (based on NoSQL and relational databases) for efficient handling of structured and unstructured data.  
   - Easy integration of new data sources and metrics (e.g., additional social media platforms or specialized analytics resources).  
   - Microservices architecture: independent modules (social analytics, news analysis, on-chain data) communicating via APIs.

## 3. Technology Stack  

1. **Real-Time Data Processing**  
   - Using frameworks like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time data collection and distribution.  

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - NLP models for text processing, sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection.  
   - Deep neural networks for price forecasting (LSTM or GRU for time series data).  
   - Variational autoencoders or hybrid models for detecting rare patterns (sudden price spikes).  

3. **Infrastructure**  
   - Cloud solutions (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and load management.  
   - Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) for flexible deployment of different modules.
